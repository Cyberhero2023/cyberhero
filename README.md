## Inspiration ‚òÅÔ∏è: 
We decided to pursue the CSE Challenge since it appealed to our fun loving nature as young adults. We felt as though we can create a game that is both informative and extremely fun/attention grabbing for young children.

The CSE challenge provided a perfect opportunity for us to show our passion for programming as well as create a humourous and silly application that we hope puts a smile on the face of its user!


## What it does üíª:
The web application is an endless tower defence game. Upon game start, the user will see bugs approaching their computer, intending to hurt the poor mainframe. It is the user's job to protect the computer and not allow the bugs to deplete it's healthbar. In order to get rid of the bugs, the user must click on them (or cycle through them using the TAB key), prompting a multiple choice question testing their knowledge on important cybersecurity topics and answering it correctly.

The game is endless, with the speed and spawn rate of the bugs increasing over time to increase difficulty. The game ends when prompted or when the mainframe's health is reduced to 0 as indicated by its healthbar.

## How we built it üë∑: 
We wanted to include as many basic game design features as we could brainstorm. These included catchy music, visually appealing graphics and visuals as well as an intuitive user interface. We managed to accomplish this using React as a game engine, an unconvential choice.  

The web application itself is built using a Typescript/CSS for its front end, and nextJS for a bit of backend. Hosted using Cloudfare. 

## Challenges we ran into üòü:
Some challenges we faced were implementing React's useEffect and useState without bugs, as well as creating custom game sprites.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ:
Some of the accomplishments we're proud of:
- User experience is perfectly tailored to the target audience
- The app is extremely accessible and easy to use
- Sprites are custom-made and animated

## What we learned üß†:
- A further understanding of React Applications
- Revisting high school physics with vector calculations
- CSS styling techniques

## What's next for Cyber  üöÄ: 
- Add a functionality that sends the automated voice call to not only emergency phone lines, but personal contacts as well.
- Improve front end features such as the UI/UX design, and responsive use features. 
- Pitch the project to local police stations, fire departments, and hospitals to spread the knowledge of our app.
